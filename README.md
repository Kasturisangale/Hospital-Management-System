This is a 'Hospital Management System' Project.

The Project in C++ is a simple console application program which is used for hospital management that would allow users to track and monitor patientâ€™s information. 

This program is open to all hospital users without the need for login information to access the system. The system user can select the category in which they specialize by simply entering a series of  numeric keys.
